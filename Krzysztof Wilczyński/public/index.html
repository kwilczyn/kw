<p>My name is Krzysztof and I have been involved in the IT industry for over 10 years.
During this time, I have held various positions, starting from working as a Manual Tester and ending as a Tech Lead in the test automation team.
Currently, I am applying for a position as a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>. I see this change as the next step in developing my passion for programming. If you&rsquo;re interested in a more detailed description of my career so far, please feel free to download my <a href="/kw/pdfs/KW_CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
<p>In the following sections of this document, I would like to show you why hiring me as a Frontend Developer will bring tangible benefits to your team.</p>

<h1 id="lets-take-care-of-your-git-repository-together">Let&rsquo;s Take Care of Your Git Repository Together</h1>
<p>For the past few years, I have worked as a <strong>Tech Lead</strong> responsible for, among other things, the quality of code automating tests at the Integration and System levels. Maintaining a dedicated repository (<strong>Gitlab</strong>) in good condition over several years required adherence to good practices related to the Git version control system by all team members. My responsibility was to maintain the highest standards and to train less experienced developers.</p>
<p>When it comes to order, I am a great advocate of using team tools such as <a href="https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/">Commitzen</a> to help unify the style of committed messages while adhering to the <strong>Conventional Commits</strong> specification.</p>
<p>The commit message format compliant with the <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">Conventional Commits</a> specification forces developers to commit changes in a readable way, facilitating easy rollbacks (if needed) and allowing convenient tracking of project history as it evolves.</p>
<p>In my opinion, maintaining order in the code repository is invaluable. Collaboration with less experienced users can complicate the work of the entire team, which is why I have always offered constructive feedback and support.</p>
<p>Pull Requests have always been an ideal tool for giving constructive feedback for me.
As a Lead, I was responsible for setting up the repository in such a way that no change could be added to the main branch without creating a mandatory Pull Request and receiving Approval from another team member. As with commit messages, I am also an advocate of standardization in the form of <a href="https://conventionalcomments.org/">Conventional Comments</a>, which improves clarity of communication and facilitates sharing constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I am a candidate with a particular commitment to good practices related to maintaining a code repository. I can&rsquo;t wait to make a positive contribution to maintaining your repository as well.</p>
<h1 id="testing-pays-off">Testing Pays Off</h1>
<p>As an experienced tester, I had the opportunity to be involved in implementing functional tests at all levels, starting from <strong>unit tests</strong> (<strong>jest</strong>, <strong>pytest</strong>, <strong>vitest</strong>), through integration tests (<strong>pytest</strong>) and ending with E2E Tests (<strong>RobotFramework</strong>, <strong>Selenium</strong>, <strong>Playwright</strong>, <strong>Cypress</strong>).</p>
<p>From experience, I know that technical debt in the form of lack of test coverage at lower levels of the test pyramid will sooner or later cause large amounts of additional work for the entire team (and thus increase the cost of the entire project). In such circumstances, new manual testers are often hired for the project, or attempts are made to cover the application with additional automated tests at the E2E level using a dedicated team of specialists. Unfortunately, E2E tests are expensive and very sensitive tests.</p>
<p>How much cheaper and more stable would it be to ensure test coverage before writing the first line of code (<strong>TDD</strong>), or simply maintain test coverage regularly.</p>
<p>As a person who previously worked in a testing position, I know techniques for designing good tests that I will be able to use in practice as a developer as well. I can easily prepare unit tests, integration tests, and component tests for my new code. Covering acceptance criteria with E2E level tests in any technology will not be a problem for me either. Concepts of tools such as stubs and mocks are not unfamiliar to me, so lack of readiness of external APIs will never stand in the way of covering the frontend part with tests.</p>
<p>Conclusion: My experience in software testing will be used to better cover code with tests at the unit level and beyond.</p>
<h1 id="automate-it-cicd">Automate It: CI/CD</h1>
<p>During my career, I often had to take care of preparing resources for running various types of tests myself. Starting with tools like VirtualBox and Jenkins, I learned to automate processes using a self-built runner-type architecture. The next step was learning the basics of containerization (<strong>Docker</strong>) giving much more flexibility.<br>
When cloud services became widespread, I started working in the IaC model (<strong>AWS</strong>).
Currently, I am in the process of <strong>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02</strong> certification training.</p>
<p>In my previous position, I was responsible for preparing pipelines for test tasks in <strong>Gitlab Actions</strong> (the equivalent of workflows in GitHub), and their maintenance. I gained experience in optimizing these types of workflows, e.g., caching, artifact sharing, and controlling dependencies. If needed, I also created my own optimized containers.</p>
<p>If you think you need someone on your team who can configure a workflow (I also have experience with <strong>Github Actions</strong>) for CI/CD processes including continuous testing at unit, integration, and E2E levels for stage-type environments, you should consider my candidacy.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I am an independent practitioner with experience in CI/CD both from the user and administrator side. Containerization and cloud services (<strong>AWS</strong>) are not unfamiliar to me.</p>
<h1 id="an-it-project-is-a-team-game">An IT Project is a Team Game</h1>
<p>From the beginning of my career, I have participated in several projects managed traditionally (<strong>waterfall</strong>) as well as those managed in an agile manner (<strong>Scrum</strong>). As a tester, I actively participated in all ceremonies including planning poker, helped in selecting acceptance criteria for tasks, presented the results of my work during demo meetings (<strong>Test Automation</strong>). I feel comfortable working with other people in a team.
I know that only through teamwork does a project have a chance for real success. There is no place for lone winners here.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I am a team player familiar with the most popular project management methodologies such as <strong>Scrum</strong></p>
<h1 id="clean-code">Clean Code</h1>
<p>So far, as a Software Developer in Test, <strong>most of my work involved writing code</strong> in <strong>Python</strong>.
Some tasks also required me to prepare scripts in <strong>javascript</strong>.
All good programming practices also applied to me when writing test code. Principles such as DRY, KISS, SOLID and using design patterns are not unfamiliar to me and have been used by me in practice over the past years.</p>
<p>I have participated in projects using a very diverse technology stack.
These were both corporate applications using Java Hibernate, SPA web applications based on Vue.js, and even monoliths based on Perl technology.</p>
<p>When testing applications, I always tried to first learn the basics of the given technology.
After some time, I offered my help in relieving programmers from the team in performing simple bugfixes.</p>
<p>When writing my code, I put great emphasis on its cleanliness. I love both volumes of Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Clean Code&rdquo; book, which opened my eyes to many issues related to maintaining order in my code.</p>
<p>When I decided to continue my career as a web developer, I started intensively training in <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>SASS</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>Vue.js</strong> to make up for gaps in my competencies. I also completed training in building professional frontend projects conducted by recognized authorities in Poland: <a href="https://www.opanujfrontend.pl/">Opanuj Frontend</a>.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I am not a beginner programmer although I am still learning, programming has been the majority of my work in recent years</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>If you are looking for a Frontend Developer candidate with diverse experience in various fields of IT projects, proactive, experienced in teamwork, and for whom quality in the project always has the highest priority - Let&rsquo;s talk!</p>
